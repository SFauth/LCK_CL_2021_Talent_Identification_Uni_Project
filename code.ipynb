We want to keep non-performance related features, as they are in the raw data: this includes the player name, his team, his position and the number of games played. Some metrics allow for just averaging over them (e.g. all averaged metrics). This is possible, as these metrics refer to an average game of a player in one split, i.e. playoff. Thus, taking their mean just means that the value now represents the average game of all tournaments, a player took part in. However, this can not be done for absolute measures who refer to a whole tournaments, such as kills. This is due to the fact that certain players have participated in different tournaments that had a different amount of games. This questions the general use of absolute measures."

    "Unfortunately, the metrics are still biased by the team and the position of a player. One should not compare the number of kills of a support and of an attack damage carry (ADC). This can be easily be taken care of by grouping by positions.\n",
    "Added to that, two players that feature the same characteristics (e.g. ability) will have different metrics. This is due to the fact that if one player is on the worst team, while the other is on the best team, he will score less kills, for example. Therefore, it is also indispensable to account for the relative rank of a player's team. In order to minimize the team's effect, we will conduct statistical tests to compare the performance of teams. Then, if a team's performance (m games won out of n games) is not statistically different from another team's, we consider then to be similar, allowing for comparison of players. First, we have to compute a team's performance. This can be done by looking at the player of the team that has played most games for it, serving as an estimate for m and n."
